This javascripts are for multiple inputs. 
Is based on 2 sections. 
All inputs without inputs type file and just inputs type file.
Why? I needed to separate the inputs because I had multiple file inputs (eg Search on PC and Take Picture with Camera), 
and to differentiate them I used browse (search on PC) and camera (for take picture) and 
the obligation was that at least one of them to be true per section (eg sections: Selfie, Identity Card, Selfie with ID card)
